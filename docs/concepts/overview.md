# Concepts overview

Phenofhy provides a small set of building blocks for OFH phenotype work:

- Extraction: build a field list and extract data from DNAnexus datasets.
- Processing: derive common variables and clean fields by entity.
- Calculation: produce summary and prevalence tables.
- Profiling: generate a basic phenotype profile report.

The package is organized by module, with each module focused on one stage of the
workflow. The API reference is grouped the same way.
